This plugin development was sponsored by the [The Social Bees](http://thesocialbees.com/)

Follow this code development on [Github](https://github.com/Feyisayo/woocommerce-globalpay)
== Installation ==
1. Ensure that you have met the following requirements:
 * WordPress 3.5 or greater
2. Uncompress the plugin on your computer
3. Using an FTP program, or your hosting control panel, upload the unzipped
plugin folder to your WordPress installationâ€™s wp-content/plugins/ directory.
4. Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu within the WordPress admin.
5. __Configure your permalink settings:__ Make sure you are __NOT__ using Wordpress' default permalink setting otherwise user re-direction from GlobalPay's website will __NOT work__. You can configure your permalink settings on the admin end by going to Settings -> Permalinks and ensure that the option selected is NOT the default.
6. __Configure your merchant credentials:__ WooCommerce -> Settings -> Payment Gateways -> GlobalPay to configure the merchant credentials (either live or demo) for GlobalPay
7. __Return URL:__ GlobalPay will require that you specify a URL on your site that your users will be redirected to after attempting to pay on GlobalPay. Use the following URL based on your website: __YOURSITE.COM/globalpay-transaction-response__
8. __Template Override:__ In the case of a __failed__ payment attempt, when the user is redirected to your site from GlobalPay Woocommerce displays the text 'Unfortunately your order cannot be processed as the originating bank/merchant has declined your transaction.'
This text can be misleading. To remove it, an override has been included with WooCommerce GlobalPay. Go to woocommerce-globalpay/resources, copy the woocommerce folder and paste it in the folder of your current theme.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How do I get a GlobalPay Merchant ID? =
Go to https://www.globalpay.com.ng/ to register. Alternatively, if you have a Zenith Bank account contact your branch to get started.

= How do I add the Naira currency to WooCommerce? =
When WooCommerce GlobalPay is installed it will automatically add the Naira currency to WooCommerce.

= Something went wrong when a user was redirected back from GlobalPay to my site. How do I know the status of the payment? =
WooCommerce GlobalPay always confirms a payment transaction's status from GlobalPay's servers after a user returns to the merchant's site. However, if the user for some reason is not properly redirected you can manually confirm the payment anytime. On the admin end, go to WooCommerce -> Orders. Find the order in question and in the "Actions" section click on the "Requery" button. Give it a few seconds and the order's status icon will change to reflect the payment information received from GlobalPay's servers.

NOTE: In WooCommerce, when an order is paid it is marked "Processing"
